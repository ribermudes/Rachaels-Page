        <h2>About Me</h2>
        I'm a student in Intro to Programming at Epicodus. Nothing in my background would have lead you to believe that I would start a coding program.
        Before coming to Epidcodus, I worked at a technology based non-profit in San Francisco. In college I studied 20th century European History
        which means I know a lot about the causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union but not much about coding. I am new to Portland, so in my free
        time I like to discover what the city has to offer. If I'm not discovering new things about Portland, I am usually knitting, cleaning headstones
        at a historical cemetery, or reading a book somewhere. I chose to attend Epicodus because I liked what the program had to offer, and I thought that
        this would be the best place to learn the skills to start a new career.
