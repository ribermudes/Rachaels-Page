      <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
          <p class="about">I'm a student in Intro to Programming at Epicodus. I like to describe myself as a freshly hatched code-ling, everything is new, terrifying, and I can't wait to learn all I can. I'm interested in front end development and during my time here I hope to develop those skills.
          </p>

          <p>
           I worked at a technology based non-profit in San Francisco. The irony of moving away from the epicenter of the tech industry to begin a career in programming isn't lost on me. But when I was accepted to Epicodus I packed up and moved.
           In college I studied 20th century European History which means I know a lot about the causes of the collapse of the Soviet Union, and I make a great addition to any Trivia Night team.
           I am new to Portland, so in my free time I like to discover what the city has to offer. If I'm not discovering new things about Portland, I am usually knitting, cleaning headstones
           at a historical cemetery, or reading a book somewhere. I chose to attend Epicodus because I liked what the program had to offer, and I thought that
           this would be the best place to learn the skills to start a new career.
          </p>
